# How does this fit the theme?

Originally, I wanted to build a narrative around the idea that your are making transformation potions! Each potion would transform a person, critter, or animal into some other critter, animal, or a different looking person. The idea being that in some ways we should view our own lives as a currency only so much as that we only have so long to live. Wouldn't it be best to live it most happily, as we most want to be seen and as who we are?

I really dislike the idea of selling or trading your life for commodities or even survival/living, so I didn't want to do anything with that concept. Instead opted for a much more affirmative idea!
